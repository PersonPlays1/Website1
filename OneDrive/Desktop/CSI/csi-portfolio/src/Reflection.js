      <div className="reflection1"> As my group approached the design review for our research on political workers, we split our exploration into three phases: soak, squeeze, and make sense. For this design reflection, I will focus on one experience I had in the soak phase. In the soak phase, we spent our time talking to and interviewing all different types of political workers to get ourselves familiar with their work. At one of our final such interviews, we interviewed a door-to-door advocate for gun control. Up to this point, every interviewee we had asked had emphasized how much better technology is than door-to-door canvassing, even if technology was expensive. But, halfway through this interview, I ask, “So what do you think of how technology is somewhat replacing door-to-door work?” Our interviewee proceeds to go on a tangent about how much more effective the human touch is and how she had never even touched that app her organization uses. While keeping respectful, our whole group what shocked by this completely different point of view we had just heard. This was the first person we had interviewed who held a point of view completely contradictory to everyone else we had spoken to, and it served as a good lesson for us as designers. 
From the experience of this interview, we learned that it is important to not jump to conclusions when designing and to really value the soak portion of our research. Before this interview, we had already begun thinking about how all political workers value and rely on technology, and we had even begun to think about a possible product space for us. We were confident that we knew what political workers were like, even though we had only conducted four interviews. After this experience, not only did we have to rethink our product space and our thoughts on political workers, but we also realized that we should not have jumped to conclusions about our engagement group. We learned that you really need to embrace the soak stage before thinking ahead to the squeeze or make sense stages, as you may have to start over completely if your soak stage was not thorough.
The lessons we learned from interviewing this one political worker are not unique to that group. Instead, they can be applied to any design project you are working on. Regardless of the group your design is meant to target, it is important to understand that group in order to create an effective product. And in order to familiarize yourself with your target group, the lessons we learned are extremely helpful. For example, if you were researching artists, you may get the impression from your first few interviews that all artists are young and poor, which would overlook many important people in the artist category. For my group, which is designing for political workers, our next steps after this surprising interview experience were very important. We first spent time going through our notes from all of our interviews, and then represented our different interviewees on different design representations. These design representations, such as 2x2 graphs or attribute spectrums, really helped us to grasp the patterns we saw between political workers, as well as the outliers such as the interviewee who didn’t use technology. If I had to give advice to an aspiring designer after this experience, it would be to not rush the process and to really embrace your target audience.
